# INSTALL GUIDE

Go the the 'ext' folder. There is a file 'install.txt'.
Copy the content of the file to clipboard.
Then open a terminal (cmd.exe) in the 'ext' folder,
paste the text to the terminal and press ENTER.
Once the command is finished you can close the terminal.

Then open a terminal (cmd.exe) in the folder of this file
and type there: code .
That will open Visual Studio Code.

Before building the project in Visual Studio Code, choose
the 'install' build target. Once the project is built, then
all binaries and data will be under 'dist' directory. This
folder is in the form suitable for the submission to IS
(without the source code though).
